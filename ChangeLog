2012-04-11  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	hud: never allow perfect match for indicators
	
	The old scoring algorithm would assign a penalty of one for searching
	for "item" and finding "Item" (due to the case).  The new algorithm
	ignores case.
	
	This caused an unintended problem: the fact that we would never get
	perfect matches (due to the fact that nobody ever properly capitalised
	their search strings) was a good thing.  The indicator penalty is
	expressed as a percentage by which to increase whatever the distance
	already was, and that doesn't work well with the now-common case of a
	perfect match (since 0 + 50% is still 0).
	
	We tweak this situation by never allowing a match from an indicator have
	a perfect score.  If the indicator penalty is requested, then the
	distance must be at least 1.

	- don't leak the collector on finalize (which never happens)

	Adjustments for Ted's review comments.

2012-04-02  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Increase the default swap penalty to 15
	
	The current value is too low.  It allows "xyze" as a valid match for "File" (3
	swapped characters at a cost of 10 each gives a total cost of 30, which is the
	maximum permitted value).
	
	It also causes an issue with accents.  Consider the case of typing
	"pref" and encountering the menu items "préférence" and "précédent".
	Clearly the user wants "préférence".  During normalisation, we convert
	each of these strings to "pre'fe'rence" and "pre'ce'dent".
	
	"pref" vs "pre'fe'rence" is best scored as the first "'" being dropped
	and the trailing "e'rence" also being dropped.  10 points for the accent
	drop plus 7 for the trailing "e'rence".  Total of 17 points.
	
	"pref" vs "pre'ce'dent" seems like it should be scored worse since the
	accent is dropped and the following character is incorrect.  Instead,
	however, the algorithm assigns a lower score for the possibility that
	the accent is replaced by the letter "f" (10 points) and then the rest
	of the characters "ce'dent" are dropped (7 points).  Also a total of 17
	points.
	
	This tie would be prevented with a higher swap cost.
	
	This problem could be fixed by special-casing the dropping of accents in
	the core search algorithm and I tested this approach but it had a
	substantial performance cost on the rather tight inner loop (nearly
	doubling the amount of time to do a search).
	
	Another possibility would be to drop all accents entirely during the
	normalisation process.  This sounds acceptable for French, but I imagine
	other languages may find this to be less than ideal.
	
	Also, consider "fl" against "file" and "fix" as another example that
	doesn't rely on accents to make its case (although the argument is
	somewhat weaker here).  This shows that we should probably just increase
	the swap cost.

	Skip checking of search terms when it's not possible to take the term
	
	There are two situations in which a term will never be taken:
	
	- the max cost has already been exceeded
	
	- the cost of taking the term can't possibly beat the cost of dropping it
	
	In those two cases, don't do the extra work.

	path of searching.
	
	- the innermost loop has been simplified free it of special-cases: it
	is now exactly equal to the reference implementation of Levenshtein
	distance from Wikipedia
	
	- we continue to support post-drops as a special-case, but other
	special cases have been removed.  pre-adds were probably a bad idea
	to start with, but it's worth talking about bringing back transposes.

2012-03-17  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	hud-service: dbusmenu collector: hold a reference on the root menu item
	
	In the root-changed case, the DbusmenuClient drops the reference on the
	root item before alerting us that it has changed.  We then go iterating
	over our own (now-dead) copy of that item in order to remove it from our
	internal hashtable.
	
	Keep our own reference to it to ensure that this is safe.
	
	This could explain lp:955937.

2012-03-16  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	hud-service: delay dropping of query by 1 second
	
	Unity sends a 'CloseQuery' followed immediately by a 'StartQuery' on
	each keystroke in the search field.  This results in a bunch of extra
	dbusmenu messages being sent as the use count drops briefly to 0 only to
	go immediately back to 1.
	
	We can prevent that by delaying the destruction of the query.
	
	This decreases the number of dbus messages resulting from a short search
	by a factor of about 4 (on a number that measures in the 100s).

2012-03-16  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	add hud-gtk to the build system

	hud-service: indicatorsource: on indicator disappearance *unuse* the dbusmenu instead of using it extra
	
	Probably this has absolutely zero impact since the source is going to be
	destroyed one line later anyway, but it reads really badly (and strictly
	speaking, the menus should be closed if they've been opened).

2012-03-15  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	add a "debug" source for testing the update signal
	
	we could use this for other testing purposes later on as well

2012-03-15  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	hud-service: on startup, set the focus window as active
	
	We were waiting for the first active-window-changed signal before we
	started tracking window menus.  Do it as soon as we start, using the
	currently-active-window.

2012-03-15  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Add some paranoid checking
	
	We don't want dbusmenu delivering signals to us while we're iterating
	our hashtable, so add an assert about that.  It doesn't do so now, but
	this will make it easier to detect the problem if it should start doing
	so in the future.

	distance: drop ignore_character() logic
	
	We currently had logic deep inside the hud's matching algorithm to
	ignore a set of characters: _(" _->")
	
	As it is, the characters ' ', '-' and '>' will never been seen by the
	algorithm because these characters are used as separators in the earlier
	tokenisation process.
	
	'_' is handled now by the HudItem code.  '_F' is turned into just 'F',
	for example.  The only way a '_' will end up at this point is if the
	application wanted a literal underscore (ie: they wrote '__' in the
	label) or if the user explicitly typed it as part of a search term.  In
	either of those cases, we should probably be treating it as a normal
	character anyway.
	
	That leaves the matter of the possibility that the translators could
	introduce additional characters here which, after discussing it, is
	probably not reasonable to support just for the sake of it.

	Don't mark hud.interface.c for translation.
	
	"make check" is failing in the po/ directory when it can't find hud.interface.c in the srcdir, so it fails if builddir != srcdir. This raises an interesting (to me, at least) question about how to get POTFILES.in to understand where to look for files generated from BUILT_SOURCES. However, there is a shorter path to solving this ticket: since nothing in hud.interface.c needs translation, removing it from POTFILES.in fixes "make check".

2011-02-03  Chris Coulson  <chrisccoulson@ubuntu.com>

	Fix LP: #706941 - unity-panel-service crashed with SIGSEGV in g_type_check_instance_cast()
	A menu item will continue to live if it is removed from it's parent whilst it is waiting
	for updated properties from the server. In this case, it is possible to get a property-changed
	signal from a menu item after already having received a child-removed signal from its parent,
	by which time the resources associated with that menu item have already been free'd. Handle
	this by ensuring we disconnect from the property-changed signal when receiving a child-removed
	signal.
	
	Also fix a couple of other bugs:
	- Ensure we keep a reference to a menuitem whilst waiting for it's first child to be realized
	- Fix menu_entry_removed to handle the case where a menu item hasn't been realized yet (and
	there is no WMEntry for it)
	- Don't leak all the IndicatorObjectEntry's when the root node changes. Calling
	menu_entry_removed from root_changed had no effect, so we provide a new helper for
	doing this
