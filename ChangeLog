	Moving menu_prop_changed back to it's old location and adding a prototype to reduce the size of the diff

2011-02-03  Chris Coulson  <chrisccoulson@ubuntu.com>

	Fix LP: #706941 - unity-panel-service crashed with SIGSEGV in g_type_check_instance_cast()
	A menu item will continue to live if it is removed from it's parent whilst it is waiting
	for updated properties from the server. In this case, it is possible to get a property-changed
	signal from a menu item after already having received a child-removed signal from its parent,
	by which time the resources associated with that menu item have already been free'd. Handle
	this by ensuring we disconnect from the property-changed signal when receiving a child-removed
	signal.
	
	Also fix a couple of other bugs:
	- Ensure we keep a reference to a menuitem whilst waiting for it's first child to be realized
	- Fix menu_entry_removed to handle the case where a menu item hasn't been realized yet (and
	there is no WMEntry for it)
	- Don't leak all the IndicatorObjectEntry's when the root node changes. Calling
	menu_entry_removed from root_changed had no effect, so we provide a new helper for
	doing this
