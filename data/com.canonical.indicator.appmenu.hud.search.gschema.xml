      <summary>The penalty given to a menu item being in an indicator</summary>
      <description>
        In order to have the application's menu items appear higher in the search results a slight penalty is
        given to the indicator menu items. This value represents then percentage of that penalty so a value of
        '50' is a 50% additional to the calculated distance.

    <key type='u' name='add-penalty'>
      <default>10</default>
      <summary>Penalty for extra characters added to the search</summary>
      <description>
        Penalty applied for extra characters that are added on the end of the string that are not related to the
        source string.
      </description>

    <key type='u' name='add-penalty-pre'>
      <default>1</default>
      <summary>Penalty for extra characters added to the search before the length of the search string</summary>
      <description>
        Extra characters that occur before the length of the search string could cover them get this penalty. In
        the case of 'return' and a search string of 'turn' the 'r' and the 'e' would get hit with this penalty.

    <key type='u' name='drop-penalty'>
      <default>10</default>
      <summary>Penalty applied if a character is dropped</summary>
      <description>
        The penalty applied for characters that were dropped off the end of the search string compared to the
        tested string. This is mostly used for seeding and creating a max gradient on the edge of the matrix, as
        mostly dropped single characters are covered by the 'drop-penalty-end' value.

    <key type='u' name='drop-penalty-end'>
      <default>10</default>
      <summary>Penalty applied if a character is dropped after the search string length</summary>
      <description>
        Drop penalty that is added to characters that are longer than the current search string. So for a search
        string of 'add' and a source string of 'added' there would be drop end penalties for both 'e' and 'd'.

    <key type='u' name='transpose-penalty'>
      <default>10</default>
      <summary>Penalty applied when characters are transposed</summary>
      <description>
        When two characters are transposed this penalty is applied. This is for values like 'ea' when the
        correct value is 'ae'. This penalty should be less than twice the swap penalty to have any effect.
      </description>
    </key>

    <key type='u' name='swap-penalty'>
      <default>10</default>
      <summary>Penalty applied when the characters are not the same</summary>
      <description>
        When two characters don't match at all this is the penalty that is given. This should probably be the
        highest penalty in the set of all the values.
      </description>
    </key>

    <key type='u' name='swap-penalty-case'>
      <default>1</default>
      <summary>The swap penalty when the swap is a case change</summary>
      <description>
        While not strictly a swap, this value allows for penalizing the search slightly when the only difference
        between the characters is in its case. For instance, 'c' vs. 'C'.
      </description>
    </key>

    <key type='u' name='max-distance'>
      <default>30</default>
      <summary>The highest distance value that is shown in the results</summary>
      <description>
        After the distances are calculated (including the indicator penalty) then all values above this max are
        dropped. This means that the history for those entries aren't looked up as well.
