/**
 * SECTION:hudsettings
 * @title: HudSettings
 * @short_description: tunable parameters
 *
 * #HudSettings is a structure that contains the value of several
 * tunable parameters that affect the behaviour of various components of
 * the HUD.
 *
 * This structure exists for two reasons.
 *
 * The first reason is that caching these values in local variables
 * eliminates the need to look them up from #GSettings on each use.
 * This vastly improves the performance of the matching algorithms (as
 * many of these values are used quite a lot from within them).
 *
 * The second reason is to improve testability.  The testcases are able
 * to hardcode sane values for the settings without worrying about
 * changes that the user may have made to their local configuration
 * (which could otherwise cause spurious test failures).

/**
 * HudSettings:
 * @store_usage_data: if usage tracking should be performed
 * @indicator_penalty: the percentage by which to increase the distance
 *   of indicators when sorting the results list
 * @max_distance: the maximum distance value we consider as being a
 *   matching result
 * @add_penalty: the penalty incurred by a character in the search term
 *   that does not exist in the item being matched
 * @add_penalty_pre: the penalty incurred by a character in the search
 *   term that does not exist in the item being matched when that
 *   character comes at the beginning of the term
 * @drop_penalty: the penalty incurred by a character missing from the
 *   search string as compared to the item being matched
 * @drop_penalty_end: the penalty incurred by a character missing from
 *   the search string as compared to the item being matched when the
 *   character is at the end of the item (ie: the search term is a
 *   prefix of the item)
 * @transpose_penalty: the penalty incurred for transposed characters
 * @swap_penalty: the penalty incurred for the substitution of one
 *   character for another
 * @swap_penalty_case: the penalty incurred for the substitution of one
 *   character for another when the characters differ only in case
 *
 * This structure contains the value of several tunable parameters that
 * affect the behaviour of various components of the HUD.
