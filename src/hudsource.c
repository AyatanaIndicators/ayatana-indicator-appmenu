/**
 * SECTION:hudsource
 * @title: HudSource
 * @short_description: a source of #HudResults
 *
 * A #HudSource is a very simple interface with only two APIs.
 *
 * First, a #HudSource may be searched, with a string.  The search
 * results in a list of #HudResults being returned.  This is
 * hud_source_search().
 *
 * Second, a #HudSource has a simple "changed" signal that is emitted
 * whenever the result of calling hud_source_search() may have changed.
 *
 * A #HudSource is stateless with respect to active queries.
 *
 * FUTURE DIRECTIONS:
 *
 * #HudSource should probably have an API to indicate if there is an
 * active query in progress.  There are two reasons for this.  First is
 * because the implementations could be more lazy with respect to
 * watching for changes.  Second is because dbusmenu has a concept of if
 * a menu is being shown or not and some applications may find this
 * information to be useful.
 *
 * It may also make sense to handle queries in a more stateful way,
 * possibly replacing the "change" signal with something capable of
 * expressing more fine-grained changes (eg: a single item was added or
 * removed).
